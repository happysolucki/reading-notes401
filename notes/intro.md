# Intro

## Big O Notation

_Big O Notation_ is used to describe the performance or complexity of an algorithm.
It focuses on the worst-case scenario and is used in reference to either execution time required or space used.

### O(1)

O(1) describes an algorithm that will always execute in the same time (or space) regardless of the size of the input dataset.

### O(N)
O(N) describes an algorithm whose performance will grow linearly and in direct proportion to the size of the input data set.

### O(N²)

O(N²) represents an algorithm whose performance is directly proportional to the square of the size of the input data set. This is common with algorithms that involve nested iterations over the data set. Deeper nested iterations will result in O(N³), O(N⁴) etc.

### O(2^N)

O(2^N) denotes an algorithm whose growth doubles with each addition to the input data set. The growth curve of an O(2^N) function is exponential — starting off very shallow, then rising meteorically.
